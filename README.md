Hello, Iâ€™m Mario Gueyraud.

I'm a UI/React developer based in Paraguay. I'm interested in design systems, web3, user/dev experience and under engineering.

I'm currently working at Belk as a Frontend Engineer, where I do integrations into their e-commerce.

Previously, I worked at Tonic3, where we did amazing products for Avery Dennison.
